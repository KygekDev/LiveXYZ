# LiveXYZ
A plugin for PocketMine-MP to show your coordinates real-time as you move.

## NOTE
This plugin has been tested only on [PocketMine-MP](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP). Compatibility with third party modified versions can sometimes be found, but no support whatsoever will be provided for use with a non-official variant of PocketMine-MP.

## Installation


1. Go to the [LiveXYZ Release Page](https://poggit.pmmp.io/p/LiveXYZ) and download a PHAR file from there.
2. Copy the downloaded PHAR to the `plugins` folder in your server folder.
3. If you're making a fresh installation, you can simply reload the server. If you're updating the plugin, you'll need to shutdown and restart the server for changes to be detected.

## Usage
- To turn LiveXYZ on:
  As a player, type `/xyz` into the chat. (You can't currently do this for somebody else or from the console). Your coordinates will be shown above the hotbar.
- To turn LiveXYZ off:
  Simply type `/xyz` again to toggle the display.

## Permission nodes:
